                    Reading isn't just for the nerds or the introverts, nor is
                    it solely the domain of self-improvement junkies and
                    academia. Think of it as the original "virtual reality." A
                    book can plunge you into new worlds, fill your mind with
                    wild ideas, or even change the way you see yourself and
                    othersâ€”all without requiring a Wi-Fi connection or a power
                    outlet. You don't need to be a bookworm to reap the rewards;
                    even diving into a story for just a few minutes a day can
                    reduce stress, enhance empathy, and make you a better
                    conversationalist at your next social gathering. So go
                    ahead, crack open a book and give your brain the kind of
                    workout that no gym can provide.
