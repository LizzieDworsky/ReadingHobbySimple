                Reading isn't just for the nerds or the introverts, nor is it
                solely the domain of self-improvement junkies and academia.
                Think of it as the original "virtual reality." A book can plunge
                you into new worlds, fill your mind with wild ideas, or even
                change the way you see yourself and othersâ€”all without requiring
                a Wi-Fi connection or a power outlet. You don't need to be a
                bookworm to reap the rewards; even diving into a story for just
                a few minutes a day can reduce stress, enhance empathy, and make
                you a better conversationalist at your next social gathering. So
                go ahead, crack open a book and give your brain the kind of
                workout that no gym can provide.
